# Tasks-Manager
Managing our daily tasks is one of the most things that get left and end up doing these tasks at the end 
of the deadline for each. A good solution for this problem is using an application where it can help 
manage the daily/monthly tasks in a way that keeps the user reminded of what tasks are left to do and what tasks are 
already done. For extra help, the user is able to note the meeting times or appointments with a 
description and date. In the case of using this type of application, user productivity will surely increase 
resulting in doing the daily tasks in time and not getting to do it the next day.
The purpose of this project is to build an application that works on Android mobile phones and help the 
user manage daily and monthly tasks and note appointments with a specific date and save it. Extra advantages will 
come which is to set a background for the main page of the application if the user wants, for example to 
remember something every time the user opens the app which can be something hard to note as words.
